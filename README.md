# DATA-Act
NIEM-conformant schemas representing types and elements required per the DATA Act (https://github.com/NIEM/DATA-Act/blob/master/xsd/extension/finance.xsd).

This is a work in progress and includes the United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) only. More will be added in the coming weeks including NIEM Version 3.0 representations of the content produced to support Recovery.gov and the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB). Included in the schema are URLs to the authoritative guidance for each  element (i.e. OMB Circ. No. A-11, etc).
